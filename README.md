**Running web app:**

1) Install NodeJS and NPM from https://nodejs.org.
2) Download or clone the project.
3) Install all required npm packages by running `npm install` or `npm i` from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
4) Start the app by running `npm start` from the command line in the project root folder, this will compile the Angular app and automatically launch it in the browser on the URL http://localhost:4200.

NOTE: You can also start the app with the Angular CLI command `ng serve --open`. To do this first install the Angular CLI globally on your system with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
